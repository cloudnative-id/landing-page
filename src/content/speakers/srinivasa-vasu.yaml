bio: |
  An open-source technology enthusiast and contributor started with a little interest in coding, but gradually fascinated by the `write once run anywhere` paradigm of Java and of late got completely hooked into `build once multiple deploys` containerization, microservices and beyond. I had the opportunity of working with some of the global customers across various industry domains like Life science, Banking, Insurance, and Airlines helping them transform the way they build software.
